# TimeKnight

A simple rust-based TUI timer program to track your time estimation for tasks.

It is not intended as a todo list or task manager, use something else for that (TaskKnight will come later!).

State is currently not saved, but it will be saved to `~/.timeknight` as a simple RON formatted file.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://git.sr.ht/~deathdisco/timeknight
```
